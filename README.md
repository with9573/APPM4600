# testrep

This first, testing repository contains a copied file from last week's lab as well as this readme document, which explains what this repository contains. 
the subdirectory structure is like folders, pretty simple stuff. access file folders from terminals with acess to this repo
looks like I need to have 2 more commits for this readme

Last one, time for bed!!
